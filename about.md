Some information about you!

### More Information

After studying towards a Computer Science degree at University of the People (https://www.uopeople.edu) for about a year, I felt I understood some basics of computer science, but the idea of starting a project from scratch terrified me. After trying my hand at https://www.freecodecamp.com for a bit, I stumbled upon Udacity's Grow with Google Front-End Scholarship Challenge. I applied, and a few months later, was accepted in! Through the Grow with Google challenge I've further developed my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills and built several small projects for practical experience. I'm looking forward to learning React and creating my portfolio page as I've since been admitted into the Front-End Nanodegree program through the Grow with Google Scholarship.
