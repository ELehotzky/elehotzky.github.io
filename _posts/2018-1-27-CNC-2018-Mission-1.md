title: #CNC2018 - Mission 1: "Goals, Assumptions, Risks"
---

<strong>I want to code more because:</strong>
I want to code more because I want to be good at this and make it a career! There's nothing more frustrating than having an idea in your head and not being able to get it on the page.

<strong>I know I’ll have reached my “code more” goal when:</strong>
Once I have a solid portfolio up with several projects and I'm able to land my first full-time programmer job or paid gig, I'll know I have reached my goal - but that's just my first goal, and doesn't mean I'll stop learning and trying to improve my skills.


<strong>My top three assumptions for reaching my goal are:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>I'll keep the motivation to make coding a priority.</li>
        <li>I'll have a portfolio with a few projects ready to go by Codeland Conf this May 2018.</li>
        <li>I'll meet people along the way who I can collaborate on projects with.</li>
    </ol>

<strong>Of these assumptions, my riskiest is:</strong>
My riskiest would probably be having the portfolio with a few projects ready to go. 

<strong>When I think about my riskiest assumption, three possible root causes are:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>I won't understand github enough to post projects.</li>
        <li>I won't have projects I feel are portfolio-worthy.</li>
        <li>I'll lose motivation or become bogged down with classwork.</li>
    </ol>

<strong>3 ways I might address these root causes are:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>I'll take a quick github course after finishing (or during) the Grow with Google course.</li>
        <li>I'll keep my classwork light, only enrolling in web development 2 (which will hopefully be similar content to the Grow with Google syllabus).</li>
        <li>I'll continue giving myself small rewards for reaching goals.</li>
    </ol>

<strong>Of these, the biggest cause that’s worth tackling first is:</strong>
I should probably buckle down and take one of the github courses first! That way I can start posting my Grow with Google projects to github, and by the end I should already have a few items for a small portfolio.
